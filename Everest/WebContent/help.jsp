            <h4><strong>Prerequisite for Installer Training Program</strong></h4>
            <p>
               <strong> Installer Training Program</strong>




Installer training program /Shop meet is a meeting planned at shop to spread 
awareness of our product and application. First we shortlist a sizeable outlet 
and Prior to the training program, we inform the owner of the outlet 2 days in 
Advance. The outlet's owner gathers his own sales staff and carpenters  in 
advance say 1 hours before the training program is scheduled to begin. 
Minimum attendance required for such program is 12 and the presence of 1 
retail sales person and 1 representative from technical team is mandatory. 
Once everything is in place we start the program by introducing our self and 
giving brief information about what the Training Program is all about. Then 
we start explaining to them one by one about different types of FCB' Product 
as well as their different applications along with Benefits. We also focus on 
the availability of our products i.e. stockists and sub-dealer networks in 
various areas. In addition to this we also try to find out whether they are 
satisfied with this training program or do they need some special training 
regarding the same. If they say YES, then we invite them to the office for 
extended training sessions. Once the CTP is over, we take feedbacks from 
them as well as treat them with Tea and snacks and once they start leaving ,
we provide them samples, brochures along with gift items. it is one and half 
hour program.
